abstract = {Research in the field of information retrieval and recommendation mostly focuses on one single evaluation method and one single quality objective. On the one hand, many research endeavors focus on system-centric evaluation from an algorithmic perspective and consider the context of use only to a minor extent. On the other hand, there are research endeavors focusing on user-centric approaches to the design and evaluation of systems. However, algorithmic quality and perceived quality of user experience do not necessarily match. Thus, it is essential for system evaluation to substantially integrate multiple evaluation methods that cover a variety of relevant aspects and perspectives. Only such an integrated combination of methods may lead to a deep understanding of users, their behavior, and experience in their interaction with a system. This half-day tutorial follows the objective to raise awareness in the CHIIR community concerning the significance of using multiple methods in the evaluation of information retrieval and recommender systems. The tutorial illustrates the "blind spots'' when using single methods. It introduces the concept of "multi-method evaluation'' and discusses its benefits and challenges. While multi-method evaluations may be designed very flexibly, the tutorial presents broadly-defined basic options of how multiple methods may be integrated in an evaluation design. In group work, participants are encouraged to select and fine-tune a specific design that best matches their research endeavor's purpose.},

	abstract = {Like many other researchers, at Microsoft Bing we use external “crowd” judges to label results from a search engine—especially, although not exclusively, to obtain relevance labels for offline evaluation in the Cranfield tradition. Crowdsourced labels are relatively cheap, and hence very popular, but are prone to disagreements, spam, and various biases which appear to be unexplained “noise” or “error”. In this paper, we provide examples of problems we have encountered running crowd labelling at large scale and around the globe, for search evaluation in particular. We demonstrate effects due to the time of day and day of week that a label is given; fatigue; anchoring; exposure; left-side bias; task switching; and simple disagreement between judges. Rather than simple “error”, these effects are consistent with well-known physiological and cognitive factors. “The crowd” is not some abstract machinery, but is made of people. Human factors that affect people’s judgement behaviour must be considered when designing research evaluations and in interpreting evaluation metrics.},

abstract = {Information about a user's domain knowledge and interest can be important signals for many information retrieval tasks such as query suggestion or result ranking. State-of-the-art user models rely on coarse-grained representations of the user's previous knowledge about a topic or domain. In this paper, we study query refinement using eye-tracking in order to gain precise and detailed insight into which terms the user was exposed to in a search session and which ones they showed a particular interest in. We measure fixations on the term level, allowing for a detailed model of user attention. To allow for a wide-spread exploitation of our findings, we generalize from the restrictive eye-gaze tracking to using more accessible signals: mouse cursor traces. Based on the public API of a popular search engine, we demonstrate how query suggestion candidates can be ranked according to traces of user attention and interest, resulting in significantly better performance than achieved by an attention-oblivious industry solution. Our experiments suggest that modelling term-level user attention can be achieved with great reliability and holds significant potential for supporting a range of traditional IR tasks.},

	abstract = {CAsT-19 is a new dataset that supports research on conversational information seeking. The corpus is 38,426,252 passages from the TREC Complex Answer Retrieval (CAR) and Microsoft MAchine Reading COmprehension (MARCO) datasets. Eighty information seeking dialogues (30 train, 50 test) are an average of 9 to 10 questions long. A dialogue may explore a topic broadly or drill down into subtopics. Questions contain ellipsis, implied context, mild topic shifts, and other characteristics of human conversation that may prevent them from being understood in isolation. Relevance assessments are provided for 30 training topics and 20 test topics. CAsT-19 promotes research on conversational information seeking by defining it as a task in which effective passage selection requires understanding a question’s context (the dialogue history). It focuses attention on user modeling, analysis of prior retrieval results, transformation of questions into effective queries, and other topics that have been difficult to study with existing datasets.},

abstract = {Users frequently modify a previous search query in hope of retrieving better results. These modifications are called query reformulations or query refinements. Existing research has studied how web search engines can propose reformulations, but has given less attention to how people perform query reformulations. In this paper, we aim to better understand how web searchers refine queries and form a theoretical foundation for query reformulation. We study users' reformulation strategies in the context of the AOL query logs. We create a taxonomy of query refinement strategies and build a high precision rule-based classifier to detect each type of reformulation. Effectiveness of reformulations is measured using user click behavior. Most reformulation strategies result in some benefit to the user. Certain strategies like add/remove words, word substitution, acronym expansion, and spelling correction are more likely to cause clicks, especially on higher ranked results. In contrast, users often click the same result as their previous query or select no results when forming acronyms and reordering words. Perhaps the most surprising finding is that some reformulations are better suited to helping users when the current results are already fruitful, while other reformulations are more effective when the results are lacking. Our findings inform the design of applications that can assist searchers; examples are described in this paper.},

	abstract = {Information seeking conversations between users and Conversational Search Agents (CSAs) consist of multiple turns of interaction. While users initiate a search session, ideally a CSA should sometimes take the lead in the conversation by obtaining feedback from the user by offering query suggestions or asking for query clarifications i.e. mixed initiative. This creates the potential for more engaging conversational searches, but substantially increases the complexity of modelling and evaluating such scenarios due to the large interaction space coupled with the trade-offs between the costs and benefits of the different interactions. In this paper, we present a model for conversational search – from which we instantiate different observed conversational search strategies, where the agent elicits: (i) Feedback-First, or (ii) Feedback-After. Using 49 TREC WebTrack Topics, we performed an analysis comparing how well these different strategies combine with different mixed initiative approaches: (i) Query Suggestions vs. (ii) Query Clarifications. Our analysis reveals that there is no superior or dominant combination, instead it shows that query clarifications are better when asked first, while query suggestions are better when asked after presenting results. We also show that the best strategy and approach depends on the trade-offs between the relative costs between querying and giving feedback, the performance of the initial query, the number of assessments per query, and the total amount of gain required. While this work highlights the complexities and challenges involved in analyzing CSAs, it provides the foundations for evaluating conversational strategies and conversational search agents in batch/offline settings.},

The evaluation of these techniques has primarily, however, focused on proprietary query logs and selected samples of queries. In this paper, we suggest that anchor text, which is readily available, can be an effective substitute for a query log and study the effectiveness of a range of query reformulation techniques (including log-based stemming, substitution, and expansion) using standard TREC collections. Our results show that log-based query reformulation techniques are indeed effective with standard collections, but expansion is a much safer form of query modification than word substitution. We also show that using anchor text as a simulated query log is as least as effective as a real log for these techniques.},

abstract = {Vertical selection is the task of predicting relevant verticals for a Web query so as to enrich the Web search results with complementary vertical results. We investigate a novel variant of this task, where the goal is to detect queries with a question intent. Specifically, we address queries for which the user would like an answer with a human touch. We call these CQA-intent queries, since answers to them are typically found in community question answering (CQA) sites. A typical approach in vertical selection is using a vertical's specific language model of relevant queries and computing the query-likelihood for each vertical as a selective criterion. This works quite well for many domains like Shopping, Local and Travel. Yet, we claim that queries with CQA intent are harder to distinguish by modeling content alone, since they cover many different topics. We propose to also take the structure of queries into consideration, reasoning that queries with question intent have quite a different structure than other queries. We present a supervised classification scheme, random forest over word-clusters for variable length texts, which can model the query structure. Our experiments show that it substantially improves classification performance in the CQA-intent selection task compared to content-oriented based classification, especially as query length grows.},

For example, if a person wanted to know when their flight to Hyderabad was leaving, a search engine might connect them with the airline where they could find flight status information. However, search engines have recently begun to try to meet people’s search needs directly, providing, for example, flight status information in response to queries that include an airline and a flight number. In this paper, we use large scale query log analysis to explore the challenges a search engine faces when trying to meet an information need directly in the search result page. We look at how people's interaction behavior changes when inline content is returned, finding that such content can cannibalize clicks from the algorithmic results. We see that in the absence of interaction behavior, an individual's repeat search behavior can be useful in understanding the content's value. We also discuss some of the ways user behavior can be used to provide insight into when inline answers might better trigger and what types of additional information might be included in the results.},

	abstract = {Digital services need access to consumers’ data to improve service quality and to generate revenues. However, it remains unclear how such services should be configured to facilitate consumers’ willingness to share personal information. Prior studies discuss an influence of selected individual traits or service configurations, including transparency features and service personalization. This study aims at uncovering how interactions among individuals’ privacy valuation, transparency features, and service personalization influence their willingness to disclose information. Building on information boundary theory, we conducted an experimental study with 286 participants on a data-intense digital service. In contrast to our expectation, we found no indication that providing transparency features facilitates individuals’ information disclosure. Relative to the personalization–privacy paradox, individuals’ privacy valuation is a strong inhibitor of information provision in general, not only for personalized services. Personalization benefits only convince consumers who exhibit little focus on privacy. Thus, service providers need to align their service designs with consumers’ privacy preferences.},

abstract = {Label Propagation Algorithm (LPA) and Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCN) are both message passing algorithms on graphs. Both solve the task of node classification, but LPA propagates node label information across the edges of the graph, while GCN propagates and transforms node feature information. However, while conceptually similar, theoretical relationship between LPA and GCN has not yet been systematically investigated. Moreover, it is unclear how LPA and GCN can be combined under a unified framework to improve the performance. Here we study the relationship between LPA and GCN in terms of feature/label influence, in which we characterize how much the initial feature/label of one node influences the final feature/label of another node in GCN/LPA. Based on our theoretical analysis, we propose an end-to-end model that combines GCN and LPA. In our unified model, edge weights are learnable, and the LPA serves as regularization to assist the GCN in learning proper edge weights that lead to improved performance. Our model can also be seen as learning the weights of edges based on node labels, which is more direct and efficient than existing feature-based attention models or topology-based diffusion models. In a number of experiments for semi-supervised node classification and knowledge-graph-aware recommendation, our model shows superiority over state-of-the-art baselines.},

	abstract = {Recent research has highlighted the importance of mixed-initiative interactions in conversational search. To enable mixed-initiative interactions, information retrieval systems should be able to ask diverse questions, such as information-seeking, clarification, and open-ended ones. QG of open-domain conversational systems aims at enhancing the interactiveness and persistence of human-machine interactions. The task is challenging because of the sparsity of question generation (QG)-specific data in conversations. Current work is limited to single-turn interaction scenarios. We propose a
              context-enhanced neural question generation
              (CNQG) model that leverages the conversational context to predict question content and pattern, then perform question decoding. A hierarchical encoder framework is employed to obtain the discourse-level context representation. Based on this, we propose
              Review
              and
              Transit
              mechanisms to respectively select contextual keywords and predict new topic words to further construct the question content. Conversational context and the predicted question content are used to produce the question pattern, which in turn guides the question decoding process implemented by a recurrent decoder with a joint attention mechanism. To fully utilize the limited QG-specific data to train our question generator, we perform multi-task learning with three auxiliary training objectives, i.e., question pattern prediction,
              Review
              , and
              Transit
              mechanisms. The required additional labeled data is obtained in a self-supervised way. We also design a weight decaying strategy to adjust the influences of various auxiliary learning tasks. To the best of our acknowledge, we are the first to extend the application of QG to the multi-turn open-domain conversational scenario. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal and its main components on generating relevant and informative questions, with robust performance for contexts with various lengths.},
