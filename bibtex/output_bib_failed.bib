  ABSTRACT =     {Web search engines have historically focused on
                  connecting people with information resources. For
                  example, if a person wanted to know when their
                  flight to Hyderabad was leaving, a search engine
                  might connect them with the airline where they could
                  find flight status information. However, search
                  engines have recently begun to try to meet people’s
                  search needs directly, providing, for example,
                  flight status information in response to queries
                  that include an airline and a flight number. In this
                  paper, we use large scale query log analysis to
                  explore the challenges a search engine faces when
                  trying to meet an information need directly in the
                  search result page. We look at how people's
                  interaction behavior changes when inline content is
                  returned, finding that such content can cannibalize
                  clicks from the algorithmic results. We see that in
                  the absence of interaction behavior, an individual's
                  repeat search behavior can be useful in
                  understanding the content's value. We also discuss
                  some of the ways user behavior can be used to
                  provide insight into when inline answers might
                  better trigger and what types of additional
                  information might be included in the results.}

  ABSTRACT =     {Digital services need access to consumers’ data to
                  improve service quality and to generate revenues.
                  However, it remains unclear how such services should
                  be configured to facilitate consumers’ willingness
                  to share personal information. Prior studies discuss
                  an influence of selected individual traits or
                  service configurations, including transparency
                  features and service personalization. This study
                  aims at uncovering how interactions among
                  individuals’ privacy valuation, transparency
                  features, and service personalization influence
                  their willingness to disclose information. Building
                  on information boundary theory, we conducted an
                  experimental study with 286 participants on a data-
                  intense digital service. In contrast to our
                  expectation, we found no indication that providing
                  transparency features facilitates individuals’
                  information disclosure. Relative to the
                  personalization–privacy paradox, individuals’
                  privacy valuation is a strong inhibitor of
                  information provision in general, not only for
                  personalized services. Personalization benefits only
                  convince consumers who exhibit little focus on
                  privacy. Thus, service providers need to align their
                  service designs with consumers’ privacy
                  preferences.}

                  label propagation},

  ABSTRACT =     {Label Propagation Algorithm (LPA) and Graph
                  Convolutional Neural Networks (GCN) are both message
                  passing algorithms on graphs. Both solve the task of
                  node classification, but LPA propagates node label
                  information across the edges of the graph, while GCN
                  propagates and transforms node feature information.
                  However, while conceptually similar, theoretical
                  relationship between LPA and GCN has not yet been
                  systematically investigated. Moreover, it is unclear
                  how LPA and GCN can be combined under a unified
                  framework to improve the performance. Here we study
                  the relationship between LPA and GCN in terms of
                  feature/label influence, in which we characterize
                  how much the initial feature/label of one node
                  influences the final feature/label of another node
                  in GCN/LPA. Based on our theoretical analysis, we
                  propose an end-to-end model that combines GCN and
                  LPA. In our unified model, edge weights are
                  learnable, and the LPA serves as regularization to
                  assist the GCN in learning proper edge weights that
                  lead to improved performance. Our model can also be
                  seen as learning the weights of edges based on node
                  labels, which is more direct and efficient than
                  existing feature-based attention models or topology-
                  based diffusion models. In a number of experiments
                  for semi-supervised node classification and
                  knowledge-graph-aware recommendation, our model
                  shows superiority over state-of-the-art baselines.}
